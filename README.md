# Pomodoro
Pomodoro Timer

This is a Python script that implements a Pomodoro timer using the Tkinter library. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This script allows you to customize the work time, short break time, and long break time according to your preference.

Prerequisites

    Python 3.x
    Tkinter library

Installation

    Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
    Install the Tkinter library if it's not already installed. You can install it using the following command:

    pip install tk

    Save the script to a file with a .py extension (e.g., pomodoro.py).

Usage

    Open a terminal or command prompt.
    Navigate to the directory where you saved the script.
    Run the script using the following command:

    python pomodoro.py

    The Pomodoro Timer window will appear.
    Click the "Start" button to start the timer.
    The timer will count down the work time (default: 25 minutes).
    After the work time is over, the timer will automatically switch to a short break (default: 5 minutes).
    After four work intervals, a long break will be triggered (default: 20 minutes).
    You can reset the timer at any time by clicking the "Reset" button.

Feel free to modify the constants in the script (e.g., WORK_MIN, SHORT_BREAK_MIN, LONG_BREAK_MIN) to adjust the durations of the work and break intervals according to your preference.
