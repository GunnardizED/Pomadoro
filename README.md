# Pomodoro
This is a Python script that implements a Pomodoro timer using the Tkinter library. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This script allows you to customize the work time, short break time, and long break time according to your preference.
